One of the most important tasks for any retail store company is to analyze the performance of its stores. The main challenge faced by any retail store is predicting in advance the sales and inventory required at each store to avoid over-stocking and under-stocking. This helps the business to provide the best customer experience and avoid getting into losses, thus ensuring the store is sustainable for operation.

In this project, I’ll use retail store https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flaviocesarsandoval/sales-product-ecommerce
available on Kaggle.

The project aims to analyze the Ecommerce retail industry and provide insights into the market trends, key players, and growth opportunities. The project will leverage data analytics tools and techniques to collect and analyze data on eCommerce sales, consumer behavior, and market trends.

Tasks:

- Shopping Analysis (including shopping behavior and user checkout behavior)

- Marketing Analysis (including customer responses to internal promotions, product or order coupons, and affiliate codes)

- A predictive model for E-commerce reports that can be used to boost online sales, conversions, and even the right product pricing based on customer sentiments.

Tools: 

- Data wrangling (python)
- Data cleaning (excel, SQL)
- Data visualization(Tableau)

Exploratory Data Analysis 

I use Excel as a tool to clean data by using its various functions and features.  Excel allows me to easily identify and remove duplicate values, correct formatting errors, remove unwanted characters, and replace missing values. I also use Excel to transform data by splitting cells, merging cells, and converting data types.

Sales Performance Analysis:

I created a sales dashboard that showed sales by product category, region, and time period. This dashboard allowed me to quickly identify top-performing products and regions, as well as sales trends over time. I also created a geographical map that showed sales by region, which allowed me to identify areas where sales were particularly strong or weak. Based on the insights gained from the sales performance analysis, we can develop an action plan to improve sales performance. For example, we can increase advertising spend in regions with lower sales, optimize pricing to improve profit margins, or develop new products to target high-value customer segments.

Trend & Seasonality

Let’s see how the sales vary with month. The above graph tells us that sales tend to spike in December, which makes sense because of the Christmas and holiday season. So, this confirms that the sales vary with the ‘Date’ (time) and there is a seasonality factor present in our data.


Customer Segment Analysis:

By conducting a customer segment analysis, we can gain insights into customer behavior, including purchase frequency, purchase amount, and product preferences. These insights can be used to develop a targeted marketing strategy for each customer segment. For instance, we can create personalized email campaigns, offer discounts or promotions, or develop new products that cater to the needs of each segment. Based on the results of the analysis, it is suggested that further campaigns should focus on the 26-30 age group, particularly female.

Product Analysis:
The dashboard is created to analyze three questions related to product analysis:
1. What are the top-selling products by revenue and quantity sold?
2. Which product categories are the most profitable?
3. How does product performance vary by region?

Based on the insights gained from the product analysis, we can develop an action plan to improve product performance. For instance, we can increase marketing spend on top-selling products, optimize pricing to improve profit margins, or improve product quality based on customer feedback. Overall, this product analysis can help us make informed business decisions and drive revenue growth.
